This module is run on an arduino using the Arduino IDE. It comunicates with the motor controller based on commands received in the form of ROS messages.

This module sets up 3 ROS subscribers on the arduino:
- throttleSubscriber: Sets drive motor effort based on float 64 input and effort limit defined in MAX_EFFORT
- steeringSubscriber: Sets steering motor effort based on float 64 input
- lightSubscriber: Toggles the light when it receives an empty message

For setup see the rosserial arduino documentation at http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials  

For the Sabertooth motor controller documnetation see https://www.dimensionengineering.com/datasheets/Sabertooth2x60.pdf 

Note that the code requires the serial write functionality of the Arduino Mega. An Arduino Uno will not work.
